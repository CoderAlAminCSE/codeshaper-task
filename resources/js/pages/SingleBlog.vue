              Vaccination is the most
              effective way to protect against infectious diseases. Vaccines
              strengthen your immune system by training it to recognise and
              fight against specific viruses. When you get vaccinated, you are
              protecting yourself and helping to protect the whole community.
              <br><br>
              A COVID-19 vaccine might:
            <ul>
              <li> Prevent you from getting COVID-19 or from
                becoming seriously ill or dying due to COVID-19 </li>
              <li>Prevent you from
                spreading the COVID-19 virus to others </li>
              <li> Add to the number of people
                in the community who are protected from getting COVID-19 â€” making
                it harder for the disease to spread and contributing to herd
                immunity </li>
              <li> Prevent the COVID-19 virus from spreading and
                replicating, which allows it to mutate and possibly become more
                resistant to vaccines</li>
            </ul>
